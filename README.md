software tool to aid research and rescue of an aircraft

When an aircraft goes missing or crashes, timely locating of the aircraft is vital for saving lives and preventing further loss. Search and rescue (SAR) operations are often delayed due to many factors, including distance, the ability to integrate real-time data, lack of communications, and environmental limits (e.g., rugged terrain, vast ocean-like conditions, poor weather conditions). Manual coordination between agencies adds to the time until the search commences. There is sufficient motivation for the development of a software tool that can assist the SAR team in an intelligent framework, and by collating flight data, satellite imagery, weather reports, sensor data, and by using some forms of predictions, the tool would be able to prioritize probable crash or distress locations. This type of software tool would permit a rapid and thoughtful response, in coordination with multiple agencies, to a plausible location of the crash or distress and curry rescue operations. Effective time savings would arise from the notification going directly to individual SAR team command centers with some predetermined strategies with information from a software tool.
